	<h1>Information on Python</h1>
	<div id="main">
		Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.
		Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. 
		I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:
		<ol>

			<li>Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>

			<li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>

			<li>Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>

			<li>Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li> 
		</ol>
		Some of the great IDE's that can be used to run Python programs and codes are: 
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html">IDLE</a>. It is a very very simple IDE which is provided within the Python JDK and provides a line-to-line interactive IDE as well as a full code editor IDE. It is very simple hence some other IDE's are required for better developement of codes.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"> PyCharm by JetBrains</a>. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems (VCSes), and supports web development with Django as well as Data Science with Anaconda. It provides a very interactive platform for coding with all possible packages and development platforms possible.</li> 
			<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime text</a> which is actually not a perfect IDE but a very simple, sophisticated text editor which supports all different kinds of programming and markup codes and prose. Its interface is very clean and clear.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a> is an open source cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in the Python language. Spyder integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython, as well as other open source software. It is released under the MIT license.</li>
			<li>Many More IDE's are available but I cannot mention all of them. Hence, I have listed the most famous ones.</li>
