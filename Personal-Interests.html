	<h1>My Personal Interests</h1>
	<div id="main">
		I have experience in various programming languages.
		I started programming from the age of 12 and my first platform was <a href="https://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ Java programming IDE</a>. I have worked for more than 4 years on BlueJ but my experience was not upto professional level as it was a clss level course. Then my hands stretched towards C++ and I pursued it through Dev C++ and Turbo C++ IDE. Then I further moved towards <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Language</a> using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm IDE by JetBrains</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. I learnt Python Programming from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/javaboynavin">Telusko</a> through their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3">Python Tutorial for Beginners</a>. Now currently I am pursuing <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-react-native?delta=0">CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native</a> so as to improve my programming skills further. But my personal interests are not limited to programming itself. I have great interests in Debating and Conferencing and I have confidence over my oration skills. I recieved a verbal commendation in an MUN organised by  <a href="https://www.ims-ghaziabad.ac.in/"> IMS Institute </a> and also a High commendation in YuvaSansad organised by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Rajdhaniyuvasansad2017/">Rajdhani Yuva Sansad </a>. Also I have won and taken part in various debating competitons and seminars. This just a glimpse of all I love to do and am intrigued by.
